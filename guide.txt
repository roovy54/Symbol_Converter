 Steps to use Symbol_Converter:

 -> The JavaCode has already been converted to ByteCode
 -> Your Job is to
                  -> clone the repository
		  -> run the files using the command 'java Main'

 Then a window would open and now in the input_text field write the text to convert 
 it into proper format. 
 like, sin(A + B) = sinAcosB + cosAsinB when typed in the input field gets 
 converted to sin(α + β) = sinαcosβ + cosαsinβ which makes it really coooll!
	
 Inorder to access the letter alpha (α) -> type letter A in capital format
                              beta  (β) -> B
                              gamma (γ) -> G
                              omega (ω) -> W
                              theta (θ) -> T
			      pi    (π) -> P

 More features would be added soon!!!
